              <br></br>
              <p>Form of request:</p><br></br>

              <p>* The requester must use the
              prescribed form to make the request for access to a record. This
              must be made to the head of the private body. This request must be
              made to the address, fax number or electronic mail address of the
              body concerned.</p>
              <p>* The requester must provide sufficient detail on
              the request form to enable the head of the private body to
              identify the record and the requester. The requester should also
              indicate which form of access is required. The requester should
              also indicate if any other manner is to be used to inform the
              requester and state the necessary particulars to be so informed.</p>
              <p>* The requester must identify the right that is sought to be
              exercised or to be protected and provide an explanation of why the
              requested record is required for the exercise or protection of
              that right.</p>
              <p>* If a request is made on behalf of another person,
              the requester must then submit proof of the capacity in which the
              requester is making the request to the satisfaction of the head of
              the private body.</p>

              <br></br>
              <p>Fees:</p>
              <br></br>

              <p>A requester who seeks access to a record
              containing personal information about that requester is not
              required to pay the request fee. Every other requester, who is not
              a personal requester, must pay the required request fee:</p><br></br>

              <p>*The head of the private body must notify the requester (other than a
              personal requester) by notice, requiring the requester to pay the
              prescribed fee (if any) before further processing the request.</p>
              <p>*The fee that the requester must pay to a private body is R50. The
              requester may lodge an application to the court against the tender
              or payment of the request fee.</p>
              <p>* After the head of the private body has made a decision on the request, the requester must be
              notified in the required form.</p>
              <p>*If the request is granted then a further access fee must be paid for the search, reproduction,
              preparation and for any time that has exceeded the prescribed
              hours to search and prepare the record for disclosure.</p><br></br>
